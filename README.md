# Machine Learning for Funne

In this project, machine learning creates a sentiment analysis model to classify skincare product ingredients that have the potential to trigger fungal acne or safe fungal acne. The sentiment analysis model use LSTM method.

# Datasets
References dataset we use in building the model:
- [Cosmetics datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/cosmetics-datasets)
- [Ingredients Sezia Website](https://www.sezia.co/ingredients)
- [Fungal Acne Safe Products](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/)


# Library Sentiment Analysis Model
- Numpy
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Embeddings
- Tokenizer

# Website Checker
We use [Sezia](https://www.sezia.co/) for checking skincare products trigger or safe fungal acne. This website contains material checking, ingredients that trigger into 4 categories (fatty acids, lipids, ester, and miscellanuous), and skincare product recommendations.
